# Web Components Detector
Chrome extension (browser action) to detect and highlight web components on a website.

Thought as a proposal for the already existing [page action extension](https://github.com/webcomponents/chrome-webcomponents-extension).
Core functionality taken from this [gist](https://gist.github.com/ebidel/4bdbe9db55d8a775d0a4).
